# PiReplay

Capture and instantly replay the last moments from your phone/computer. 

You can capture replays from the web application `pireplay.local` controlling a [Raspberry Pi](https://www.raspberrypi.com) with a camera.

Take a look at the project's [roadmap](docs/roadmap.md) to see upcoming features (and all the work accomplished).

**Note** - Check out the `pireplay` [Python](https://www.python.org) package (CLI) on PyPI: <https://pypi.org/project/pireplay> (managed using [Poetry](https://python-poetry.org/)).

## User Guide

1. Make sure you stand close to a running PiReplay device.
2. Using your phone/computer, connect to the PiReplay Wi-Fi network, usually named `PiReplay-XXXX`.
3. Using a web browser, navigate to the following URL `http://pireplay.local` or `http://10.42.0.1` (you might need to accept security warning).
4. Congratulations, you can now use the Web interface to capture, watch and download live replays!

## Project Structure

A short description of the project's structure for quick reference:

- `cad`: for 3D models files, 3D printing
- `src`: the source code of the Python `pireplay` package

## Do It Yourself

Here are the instructions (tutorial) for setting up a fully working **PiReplay** device.

### Requirements

- Raspberry Pi board (recommended board: `Raspberry Pi 5 4GB` for pireplay, or `Raspberry Pi Zero 2 W` for pireplay mini)
- Micro SD card (at least 64 GB)
- Raspberry Pi Camera module 3 (regular 75Â° sensor)
- CSI Camera FPC connector cable to Raspberry Pi (select the correct one depending on you Raspberry Pi board)
- Raspberry Pi alimentation (Micro USB/USB type C), make sure both the cable and alimentation provide sufficient voltage
- PiReplay box (see below)

#### PiReplay box

You can 3D print the corresponding box for the PiReplay device.

### Quick Raspberry Pi Setup

1. Download and install the Raspberry Pi OS Imager: <https://www.raspberrypi.com/software/>
2. Connect the SD card to your computer and flash the OS on the card using Raspberry Pi OS Imager
    1. _Raspberry Pi Device_: select your correct device (`Raspberry Pi 5`, `Raspberry Pi Zero 2 W`, ...)
    2. _Operating System_:  Raspberry Pi OS (other) > `Raspberry Pi OS Lite (64-bit)`
    3. _Storage_: Select SD card
    4. _Next_ > Edit Settings (additional configuration)
        - General > Set hostname: `pireplay.local`
        - General > Set username and **password**: `pireplay` (use a secure password)
        - General > Configure wireless LAN: use your current Wi-Fi network credentials (only for setup purposes, we will use a Wi-Fi Hotspot configuration later).
        - Services > Enable SSH (using password authentication)
    5. Flash the SD card and wait till it completes
3. Insert the SD card inside the Raspberry Pi and power it using the micro USB cable (wait a few seconds)
4. Connect to your Raspberry Pi using an SSH client (on the same Wi-Fi network credentials used in the configuration)
    - You can connect using [Putty](https://www.putty.org/), or simply running `ssh` from your terminal
    - Connect using `pireplay@pireplay.local` as the host (use port 22)
    - Enter the password you specified in Pi OS Imager during configuration

You are now connected via SSH to your newly setup Raspberry Pi for PiReplay.

### PiReplay Setup

Once connected to the Raspberry Pi via SSH, you can install and set up the `pireplay` software to run on it.

```sh
sudo apt update
sudo apt upgrade -y
sudo rpi-update

sudo apt install -y python3-picamera2 --no-install-recommends
sudo apt install -y ffmpeg python3-pip

sudo pip install pireplay --break-system-packages

(crontab -l 2>/dev/null; echo "@reboot sudo pireplay run") | crontab -

sudo reboot
```

**Note** - You might need to accept some installs/updates if prompted.

Congratulations, you now have a working PiReplay!

### Troubleshoot

If you run into network problems on you device, you might want to use SSH over USB to fix them.
Follow this tutorial to enable SSH over USB: <https://gist.github.com/etoxin/d96418f0732c0de36f0f3c22f9bdd75d>.
